Below you will find an overview of the various types of documentation that will help you to use the PGO service, and to integrate it into your own DSO systems solution. The PGO server can be accessed through a HTTP API. This contains functionality for setting up one or several grid configuration problems, running the PGO algorithms, monitor the search progress, and retrieved the resulting grid configurations.

The following documentation is available for the PGO service:

 * [An introduction to the PGO model](introduction.md)
 * [Modelling examples](modelling-examples.md)
 * API documentation:
   * [Getting started using the API](api-getting-started.md)
   * [Full API reference](https://pgosintef.azurewebsites.net/swagger/index.html)
